# NLP - 2025s2

Instructor: Tiago Tavares -- tiagoft1 [at] insper [dot] edu [dot] br

Office no. 4, 7th floor, building Q300.

## Office hours

Thursdays, 13:30-15:00, online (channel: to be defined!)

## Classes

We will have 

* Theory: when we learn new, theoretical things. These classes will have a lot of whiteboard and only some focused activities.
* Case study: in these classes, students will read a case, and reflect upon that case using a questionnaire. The objective is to discover details of implementations and analyses, as if we were looking at an example.
* Practice: these classes are part of the APSs

## Grades

### APS

They can be done individually, or in groups of 2 or 3 (use Blackboard to set the groups. You do not need to have the same group in any two activities). Grades are based on credit/non-credit. In principle, if you submit the practice within the deadline, you get credit. However, you might be requested to explain details of your implementations during class or during office hours (I will send a message if that is the case). Failing to explain the requested details will result in changing the grade to non-credit to *all* members of the group, as this is evidence of failure of the related learning process.

### Written exams

We will have two written exams. They will be scheduled outside the official Insper test weeks. The exams will consist of case studies related to the APSs and the coursework. They are individual, on paper, without access to books, computers, or any other electronic devices.

### Final project

At the end of the course, we will have a final project with a free theme. We will discuss more details on this later.

### Grade calculation

The final grades will be calculated as:

* $E_1 \rightarrow$ The first exam
* $E_2 \rightarrow$ The second exam
* $P \rightarrow$ $10 \times$ the fraction of APS exercises with credit
* $F \rightarrow$ The final project

Final grade:

$$
G = \frac{2 E_1 + 3 E_2 + 2 P + 3F}{10}
$$
