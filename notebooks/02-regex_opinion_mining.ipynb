    "\n",
    "You might have figured out by now that searching for words in a large collection is very inneficient. To avoid such searches, many databases implement a data structure called an \"inverted index\".\n",

    "The inverted index is essentially a dictionary whose key is a word from the vocabulary, and whose value is a list (or set) of references to documents that contain that word.\n",

    "        'argentina' : [2, 3]\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "means that \"brazil\" appears in documents 0, 1, and 2, while \"argentina\" appears in documents 2 and 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "You might want to stem/lemmatize the words before implementing the inverted index.\n",
    "\n",
    "(a) Complete the function below to generate an inverted index for a news dataframe, which will allow searching among news based on keywords. HINT: use `CountVectorizer` to save yourself some time!\n",

    "## Exercise 6: Topic modelling\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that our documents are now represented in a $X \\in \\mathbb{R}^{D \\times V}$ matrix. In this matrix, each word is completely independent from each other. However, we know that some words are more likely to appear together in real texts.\n",
    "\n",
    "These groups of words that appear together are called \"topics\". The act of finding topics is called \"topic modelling\". One of the current state-of-the-art ideas for topic modelling is called [Latent Dirichlet Allocation](https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume3/blei03a/blei03a.pdf), or LDA.\n",
    "\n",
    "LDA is a fast technique that assumes $X$ contains discrete counts of words in each document, and then calculates an approximation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "X \\approx B A,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $B \\in \\mathbb{R}^{D \\times T}$ and $A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{T \\times V}$, and $T$ is an arbitrarily chosen number of topics. Essentially, $B$ informs how much each document participates in each topic, and $A$ informs how much each word in the vocabulary participates in each topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code to use LDA adequately is a bit tricky.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is one example. Interpret the outputs, and then try to change the number of topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Which matrix ($B$ or $A$) is represented by `lda_model.components_`?"
