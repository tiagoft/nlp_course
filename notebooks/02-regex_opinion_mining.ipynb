    "\n",
    "You might have figured out by now that searching for words in a large collection is very inneficient. To avoid such searches, many databases implement a data structure called an \"inverted index\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The inverted index is essentially a dictionary whose key is a word from the vocabulary, and whose value is a list (or set) of references to documents that contain that word.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, the inverted index below:\n",
    "\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        'brazil' : [0, 1, 2],\n",
    "        'argentina' : [2, 3]\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "means that \"brazil\" appears in documents 0, 1, and 2, while \"argentina\" appears in documents 2 and 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "You might want to stem/lemmatize the words before implementing the inverted index.\n",
    "\n",
    "(a) Complete the function below to generate an inverted index for a news dataframe, which will allow searching among news based on keywords. HINT: use `CountVectorizer` to save yourself some time!\n",
    "\n",
    "(b) Use your inverted index to search for news documents that contain \"brazil\" AND \"president\". What does the DF distribution say in this case?\n",
    "\n",
    "(c) Use your inverted index to search for news documents that contain \"brazil\" BUT DO NOT CONTAIN \"football\" or \"soccer\". How is the DF distribution in this case?"

    "\n",
    "So far, we have learned how to use classic NLP techniques to get a gist of the news. However, large language models (LLMs) seem to be the new state of the art for such. \n",
    "\n",
    "Well, we would like a summary of all news related to Brazil. Our classical methods are highly biased by the fact that most news are about football - let's see what LLMs can do for us here!\n",
    "\n",
    "For such, we will use Google Gemni, which has a great free tier that is just enough for our learning purposes. Go to https://aistudio.google.com/ and get yourself an API key. Then, add the key to the `.env` file in your system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Check how prompting works - it is essentially like using ChatGPT.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Can you control the prompts so that summaries are more verbose or less verbose?\n",
    "1. What happens if you don't provide the model with the news you want a summary of - maybe changing the prompt to \"give me a summary of news in Brazil from 2022 to 2024\"?\n",
    "1. What happens if you ask a direct question?"
